# Installation and Usage

Assuming you have flavours running and you can successfully run something like `flavours apply atelier-cave`:

* Put `rofi-base16` in your path and run it.
* Optionally, put `rofi-base16.desktop` in `~/.local/share/applications` so you can use it with graphical launchers such as rofi.
